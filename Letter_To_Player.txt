Dear, Minecraft Player

Thank you for downloading this mod, We at Laboratories INC will like to be the first to say congrats on finding this mod.

	What we at the conpany like to see is how the world of minecraftia will take this mod and what you think needs to go.

My name is AndrewTru, you can find me and the modder Donoya on GitHub if you have any ideas just ask one of us and we will try to
acamindate your request. The mod itself is tame, it what you may call a ANCMA or another crafting mod attamet
But most of it is just crafting tables that help you build more complex system into your world.
you start at the Coal level and work your way up the levels but Donoya has said that the 'Gods' have been angored by what is
at the end an unknown tenth level of power the labs this mod adds will help you find and if your found 'ready' unlock this tenth power. I am sorry if this letter is a bit odd to you but I had to make this clear you must not try to unlock the tenth power, it is on the level that Minecraftia will change as a byproduct of your work.
I end with this, work with the labs, find your Path, and work with one another to better or make worse the world of Minecraftia.
