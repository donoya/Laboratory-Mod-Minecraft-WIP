Dear, Minecraft Player

Thank you for downloading this mod. We at Laboratories INC will like to be the first to say congrats on finding this mod.

	What we at the conpany like to see is how the world of minecraftia will take this mod and what you think needs to go.

My name is AndrewTru, you can find me and the modder, Donoya, on GitHub. If you have any ideas, just ask one of us and we will try to
accomadate your request. The mod itself is tame. It what you may call an ANCMA or another crafting mod attempt
But most of it is just crafting tables that help you build more complex systems into your world.
You start at the manual level and work your way up. But Donoya has said that the 'Gods' have been angered by what is
at the end. An unknown tenth level of power that the labs this mod adds will help you to find. If your found 'ready', unlock this tenth power. I am sorry if this letter is a bit odd to you but I had to make this clear you must not try to unlock the tenth power, it is on the level that Minecraftia will change as a byproduct of your work.
I'll end with this: work with the labs, find your Path, and work with one another for better or worse to forever change the world of Minecraftia.
